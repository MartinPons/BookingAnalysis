## Booking Analysis

Author: Mart√≠n Pons

### Description

BookingAnalysis is a **Python package** at a very early stage of development. Its main purpose is to automatize common operations performed with booking reservations related data, like modifying booking features, aggregate a DataFrame of bookings into different time windows, make YoY, YTD comparisons both numerically and visually, or creating booking paces.

At this stage of development, the library is just composed of a **Booking class** with inherits from pandas Series, and functions to rearrange and aggregate data.
For now, its most interesting functionality is the method **expand**, which rearranges a Booking instance into a DataFrame of stay days, from which the rearrangement functions operate.

Most of the aforementioned features are still pending.
